- ASSIGNED to Doug to figure out LOE
The Team UI will not show that a run has not been accepted by
the server when the contest clock is stopped, the exception
is written to the API console.  
The UI should show a message to the team about the run being rejected.

- ASSIGNED to Doug to figure out LOE
Cosmetic: Move the Team Interface: <login> from the
top of the display to the title bar.

------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY 2 - LOWER PRIORITY
------------------------------------------------------------

- No confirmation on submit nothing to tell you that the
item was submitted.

- Test: 
  submit run - is there a confirm?
  submit clar - is there a confirm?

- Enh: make the directory "file_uploads" configurable instead of
hard coded to under the JAR/ directory.

- The special effect when changing menu items (disappear/reappear) is a bit annoying. :)

- On change of tab, refresh data on that tab.

- We should include scripts that run/start the EWU Team backend aka
	cd JAR
	java -jar PC2JavaServer.jar

- We should test whether chmod 777 file_uploads is needed.

	Per Troy, source should not be under CodeFreeze.  Should just
	remove that directory and move things down libs should be under
	lib not JAR source should be under source not JAR PHP source
	directories should be moved under src/ as well.

Per Troy, there should be a tag marking the original code
delivered on version/build 2.

NOTES

May need to install PHP5 on web server.  ubuntu command to install php
on a web server 
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5

- PHP using insecure include statements
fix: Must update php.ini, in PHP they are using include (URL)
should not be using that, oh well.

In: /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
; http://php.net/allow-url-include
allow_url_include = On
