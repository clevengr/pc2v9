This provides an overview of how pc2 transforms the XSLT files
into HTML used by the ICPC Finals and Pacific Northwest Contest.

The scoreboard module looks 1st for xsl in ./data/xsl, if that directory
does not exist, it falls back to the data/xsl directory under the 
pc2 installation directory.

index.xsl
  Sample index as used at the ICPC Pacific Northwest Contest.
  Includes links to group_*.html files
group.xsl
  Sample per-group(region/site) files (based on the groupList/group[included = 1].

or
wf.index.xsl
   Like the summary.html, but with the ICPC World Finals ranking
   system.  Includes links to the group?.html files
wf.group.xsl
   Like the above group.xsl, except with ICPC World Finals
   ranking system.
wf.standings.xsl
   The end of the contest final standings with Honorable Mention and
   SuperRegion champions.

If wf.index.xsl is placed in the data/xsl directory, an html called
wf.index.html will be created by the scoreboard module.  Typically
if you are going to use the world finals ranking system you would
call this index.xsl/group.xsl (eg remove the "wf." part).
